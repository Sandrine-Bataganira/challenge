== The mission

In teams of four you have to create a repository called _exercise-markdown_, in
which you will add two files: _README.md_ and _markdown.md_. _README.md_ will
have a description of the repository, as well as, a list of the group's member.
While _markdown.md_ will talk about what's *MarkDown* (description, purpose,
etc...) and respect the _content_ section .

== Group's Member :

** Alexandre Garcao
** Sandrine Bataganira
